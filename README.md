## Introduction

**Business365** is a web application crafted with the power of the MERN stack â€“ MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This dynamic platform empowers users to explore businesses, delve into business specifics, share reviews, and engage with fellow reviewers. The project harnesses the capabilities of MongoDB, storing essential business data, user profiles, and reviews.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Business search and filtering
- Business details and reviews
- User review submission and rating
- User profile management
- Interactive user interface

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB database (local or cloud-based)
- A code editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code
- Optional: Backend API using Node.js and Express.js for user authentication and data handling

Please note that this project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for the frontend and backend. You'll need Node.js and a MongoDB database to run the project locally. Additionally, you can set up a separate backend API using Node.js and Express.js to handle user authentication and data storage if needed.

If you prefer a cloud-based MongoDB solution, you can use services like MongoDB Atlas.

## Getting Started

## Technologies Used

The "business365" project utilizes the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for efficient storage of business information, user profiles, and reviews.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js web application framework, serving as the backend API to manage data and handle requests.
- **React**: The frontend library responsible for building an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime used for server-side development, powering the backend of the application.
- **npm**: The package manager for Node.js, facilitating the installation of project dependencies.
- **Optional: Firebase**: Can be integrated for additional authentication and data storage, although MongoDB serves as the primary database.
